# Giving a workshop or talk

Sharing your knowledge with others is an amazing way to give back to the community which can also greatly benefit your own development. They do after all say a great way to learn something is to teach it!

We run monthly talk evenings but can also arrange meetups at other times if our content is for example best suited during a weekend as it requires more time than an evening session. Giving a talk at one of our meetups can also be a great practice for giving the same or another presentation a conference. We also run sessions on writing your CFP (call for papers) submission for conferences.

You don't need to be an expert to give a talk, sharing anything you have learnt will certainly help someone else. We will also help you by discussing the idea together and/or giving feedback on a dry run through (rehearsal).

We have put together this [speakers guide](./speakers_guide.md) to help you get started but feel free to reach out to us if you have further questions.

## Who can speak at our events

Our events are open to everyone, unless stated otherwise, however, we do give preference to speakers who are gender minorities. We also encourage men who would like to speak to support other speakers either as a mentor or co speaker.

## What topics are interesting

We have a wide range of people of differing experiences in our community. Of course anything Python is greatly appreciated but we also value talks on topics that are important to general engineering skills or broader topics such as devops.

## Non coding super powers

Not all talks need to be technical in subject, we welcome talks that empower and inspire our community in other skill sets such as how to negotiate their wage, how to practice mindful goal setting, how to ask questions, or how to journal. We normally leave space at our events for a 5 minute lighting talk that is on a foundational topic such as those mentioned, this section is named non coding super powers to highlight the importance of also developing in parallel such skills.
