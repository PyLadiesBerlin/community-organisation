# PyLadies

PyLadies is an international mentorship group for marginalized genders, such as but not limited to non-binary people, trans people, and women in tech, with a focus on helping our community become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. All skill levels welcome!

Founded in 2011 during PyCon PyLadies was a response to the lack of representation and diversity within the Python community. 

Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings. To learn more about the global community, visit the [PyLadies website](https://pyladies.com).

## PyLadies Global council

In 2020 a global PyLadies council was formed. The Council has 9 seats, including 6 seats selected by public election with a 2 year service commitment and 3 seats selected by application with a 1 year service commitment. Additionally the [Council has a diversity and inclusion requirement](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/blob/main/process/pyladies_global_council_election_proposals.md#diversity-and-inclusion-requirements) that sets a maximum of 3 seats to be filled by members from the same country of residence. You can read more about the council [here](https://pyladies.com/blog/Announcing-the-Inaugural-PyLadies-Global-Council/inaugural-pyladies-council/).
