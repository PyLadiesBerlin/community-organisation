For guidelines on how for our social media accounts you can check out our documentation [here](./social_media.md).

(google-group)=
## Google group

The google group is used to be able to share files and calendar invites. To get access please send an email to [berlin@pyladies.com](mailto:berlin@pladies.com)

(lastpass)=
## Lastpass

We are currently using Lastpass premium family (due to expire in Sept 2023) this allows us to share full folders with "family members", the number of members allowed is limited but individual passwords can be shared also. The most active members will be given access to the shared folder and other members can request for certain passwords to be shared with them.

(2fa)=
## 2FA

For some of our accounts we have 2FA set up, this offers an additional layer of security but poses a problem of shared authentication. To get around this we have set up a phone number with Telynx that can be used for 2FA and sends messages to the slack channel #2fa-open

### Example 2FA Googlemail

With Google it is likely you will first see the following screen hat is linked to a specific device:

```{image} ../assets/imgs/2fa_1.png
:alt: 2fa workflow step 1
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 400px
:align: center
```

To avoid relying on finding the person with the device to find the code we set up the joint 2FA with Telynx. To use this you will need to choose `Try another way` at the bottom of the screen.

```{image} ../assets/imgs/2fa_2.png
:alt: 2fa workflow step 2
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 400px
:align: center
```

Then select `Get a verification code at (***)***_**17`

```{image} ../assets/imgs/2fa_3.png
:alt: 2fa workflow step 3
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 400px
:align: center
```

The code will be available in the PyLadies slack in the channel `#2fa-open`.


(email-account-management)=
