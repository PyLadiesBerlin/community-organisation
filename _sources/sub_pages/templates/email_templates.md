## Job Posting Emails

Hi {POSITION_ADVERTISER}, 

It is great to see that {COMPANY NAME} wants to share your open positions with our community. As well as reaching a community of talented Python engineers you can also increase diversity by hiring members of our community, however, we would strongly recommend that you also look into achieving inclusion that can sustain such diversity. We highly recommend reading Elizabeth Black's short article [1] regarding writing inclusive job descriptions in case you are not already familiar with it.

If you'd like, you're welcome to share your job posts in our slack [2] in the channels #jobs and #jobs-europe. We recommend that you explicitly mention what makes the working environment inclusive as this is important to many of our members.

Best wishes,

{PYLADY} & the Berlin PyLadies

Hi {SPEAKERS NAME} :smile:

We are so excited that you want to share your knowledge with our community. We would like to invite you to speak at our Meetup on {DATE} :heart_eyes:

I'm {PYLADY}, I am organizing the event and will be your point of contact. Please reply to this email and let us know if the date works for you.

I will be publishing the meetup page soon and announcing the event on our social media. For that, we will use the information you provided us in the Google form but no problem if you need to update any information, just let us know.

I wanted to also take the opportunity to share this [speaker guide](https://github.com/PyLadiesBerlin/resources/tree/main/organizing/sub_pages/speakers_guide.md) [TODO check link] with you, it covers both workshop & speaking events, so not everything will be applicable.

[OPTIONAL - IF SPEAKER REQUESTED A DRY RUN]

As you requested a dry run in the form I would like to suggest we meet {LOCATION OR ONLINE} on {DATE} at {TIME}, let me know if that works for you and I will send you a calendar invite.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or I can already be of assistance. :smile:

Greetings,

PyLadies¬†Host¬†form:¬†https://forms.gle/gG1YXb7jVz4SSgDAA

### Host confirmation email

**:white_check_mark: To be sent roughly five-week before the meetup**

Hi {HOST CONTACT NAME} :smile:

we are really happy to know {HOST NAME} would like to support our community by hosting one of our events. We would like to know if you can host our event on {the evening of | during the day on DATE}. Please let us know as soon as possible by replying to this email if the date works for you, if not, no problem we will keep you in mind for a future event.

[OPTIONAL IF THEY OFFERED CATERING 
In the form you mentioned you would be able to also supply catering if you are still able to provide this please let us know, as we don't have any bank accounts for our community it is our preference that you order and pay for this. We can help with suggesting services we have used in the past, let us know if you need any support. We normally have 30-50 attendees but will confirm the expected number of attendees one week before the event.

[OPTIONAL IF THEY OFFERED CHILD CARE]
In the form you mentioned you would be able to also supply child care, we will open a form to collect the requirements from attendees, and we will share the results as soon as we have them, latest 3 weeks before the event. We ask that you book the child care direct, if you have a service you are already familiar with then it is fine you use it, in the past, we have used the following service and can recommend it: www.babysitter-express.de We are also aware of https://www.nikis-kinderclub.de/ as a potential alternative.

Greetings,
{PYLADY} & the Berlin PyLadies :woman_technologist::snake:

***Also add if applicable***
- ask if there are location specific information or clarify anything unclear in the form

### Host follow-up email

**:white_check_mark: To be sent roughly one week before the meetup**

Hi {HOST CONTACT NAME} :smile:

our meetup is coming up and we are much looking forward to collaborating with {HOST NAME}!

If you have any outstanding questions please let us know. We have {NUMBER OF ATTENDEES ON MEETUP} signed up and based on previous experience are expecting roughly {NUMBER OF ATTENDEES ON MEETUP / 3} to {NUMBER OF ATTENDEES ON MEETUP / 2} attendees (though please note this can be difficult to predict).

We will come to the location circa half an hour before the event to check the setup and allow for speakers to test their slides. If you require us to support folks coming into the location let us know so we can ensure there is someone available to do this. In our [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_SNnpaWBK3I74e4TWW4wudf6JMGBSYaq_90W2BiCiEk/edit?usp=sharing) you will find a couple of PyLadies branded signs which can be used to help guide attendees to the right place (if you prefer to make your own please use one of the logos found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dV2Ezol4Ikf3J2a1TtZ8hfrLrhl2rOY5?usp=sharing)).

You can find our planned agenda (including when you have time to present yourselves) on our meetup page: {EVENT MEETUP PAGE}

Best wishes & thank you again for your support,

### Sponsor thank you email

Thank you for making our event a success ‚ù§

Thank you for making our event this past week a success! All the attendees who filled in our form told us they consider the space a safe and friendly environment, which is one of our top priorities. In fact, the vibe of the evening and feeling welcome and inspired were comments that almost all those who filled in the form mentioned, so a huge thank you to all speakers and hosts for making that the case!

There were also a lot of comments around the topics our speakers chose and how motivational they were in terms of career-changing, staying healthy, and meeting your ambitions!

The only improvement comments we received were to do it more often üòÖ

If you want to put the jobs on our Slack and didn't already please join via https://slackin.pyladies.com the channel is #jobs-europe 

The video from the event is here: https://www.youtube.com/@PyLadiesBerlin

As speakers and hosts if you have any feedback for us we would love to hear it, we don't have a separate form but if you can drop us an email it would be appreciated.

Wishing you a great end to the week and weekend,
Jessica & PyLadies Berlin
